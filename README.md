# ðŸ‘½ Desing tools

## Sharing bits

This week topic has been related to the use of collaborative design methods, especifically in terms of programming. I am an industrial designer from Peru working in the public sector and I believe these new tools will allow me to xplore new possibilities to innovate that sector. Documentation is not something everyone is used to, so it will be really challenging to explain, share and replicate this lessons learned to all m co-workers.&#x20;

The next page (if I did it well) is about OPENAI and its AI writing to explai my masters final project. It is really interesing to see the answers coming from that platform because they are coherent. It makes me question abotu the future: what will happen to all that people that were hired in order to think and type? Now that AI does almost everything, I assume there are some possibilites:

1.- people will have more time to do other things

2.- people might not be needed (hired) to do type a letter or a resolution because AI will do it fast.

3.-public servants might have to learn the implications and applications of AI

4.- people will have to think less because technology will do the work.

5.- I could continue with this but I have no time left!



Let's explore the result of my "conversation" with AI. Loved the answers!
